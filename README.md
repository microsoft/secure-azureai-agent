# Secure Azure AI Agent

A secure, enterprise-ready AI agent system for Azure troubleshooting and support scenarios. This application provides intelligent assistance for Azure-related issues through a multi-agent architecture built with Microsoft Semantic Kernel.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for different types of Azure troubleshooting scenarios
- **Secure by Design**: Enterprise security features with Azure AD integration and secure credential management
- **Real-time Chat Interface**: Interactive web-based chat powered by Chainlit
- **Azure Integration**: Deep integration with Azure services and APIs for comprehensive troubleshooting
- **Observability**: Built-in telemetry and monitoring with OpenTelemetry
- **Scalable Deployment**: Ready for Azure App Service deployment with infrastructure as code

## Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI-based REST API with Semantic Kernel agents
- **Frontend**: Chainlit web interface for user interactions
- **Infrastructure**: Azure App Service deployment with Bicep templates
- **AI Services**: Azure OpenAI integration for intelligent responses

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Azure subscription
- Azure OpenAI service endpoint

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/secure-azureai-agent.git
   cd secure-azureai-agent
   ```

2. Copy the environment file and configure your settings:
   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   # Edit .env with your Azure OpenAI and other service configurations
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Frontend
   cd ../frontend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   # Start backend (in one terminal)
   cd backend
   python -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload
   
   # Start frontend (in another terminal)
   cd frontend
   chainlit run app.py
   ```

### Azure Deployment

Deploy to Azure using Azure Developer CLI:

```bash
azd auth login
azd init
azd up
```

## Configuration

Environment variables are now centrally documented in `CONFIGURATION.md`.

Minimal required variables to run locally:

```
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=...
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

Optional (typical) additions:

```
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4
BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

See `CONFIGURATION.md` for full list, production hardening guidance, and Foundry agent mode settings.
